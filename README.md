# Tasting ML Model

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a machine learning model using the Iris dataset. The goal is to "taste" how a machine learning model is built, trained, and evaluated. The model predicts the species of iris flowers based on their features.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples each from three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample has four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## Model
We use a basic Decision Tree Classifier for this task. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and tested on the remaining data to evaluate its accuracy.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tasting-ml-model.git
    cd tasting-ml-model
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook tasting_ml_model.ipynb
    ```

4. Explore the notebook to see how the model is built and tested.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- jupyter
